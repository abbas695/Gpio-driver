# Gpio-driver

in this project i wirote a driver for the gpio of stm32 micro-controller 
this includes to :
1-to initialize the pin as input or output
2-read or write to a spicified pin
3-to chose the mode of an input pin(Pull-up,pull-down-no pull)
4-and since this project was for getting the 8 colors of an RGB led using a button , i added a debounce function.
